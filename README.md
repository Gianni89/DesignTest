# ReadMe

Inlcuded in this folder are three files that comprise my design test for Mediatonic, "Design Test: Daily Bonus Challenge". For this test I was provided the following brief:

>We would like you to write a design specification for a 'Daily Bonus' feature for 'Heavenstrike Rivals'.
>
>The game is currently free to download and play on both iOS and Android devices (links on following website):
>
>http://www.heavenstrikerivals.com/
>The feature should primarily aim to improve retention on the title.
>
>It should thematically fit within the game-world, and ideally work with the currently available currencies and rewards.
>
>It should be possible to give your documentation to a programmer & UI designer and for them to implement this feature with minimal support and instruction.

## Files

### Design Presentation.pptx

[**Click to download**](https://github.com/Gianni89/DesignTest/blob/master/Heavenstrike%20Rivals%20-%20Feature%20Design/Design%20Presentation.pptx?raw=true)

This powerpoint presentation is a complete overview of the feature design with visual flow, suitable for presenting the feature to team members or other interested parties. The presentation includes animation and **should be viewed in powerpoint as a slide show**. If not viewed as a slide show, several slides will lose their context, or hide important information.

If you do not have PowerPoint available, free software [PowerPoint Viewer](http://filehippo.com/download_powerpoint/download/b091063e0658609d3c5f0b8883a9139d/) is available that will allow you to view the document properly.

If opening the document in PowerPoint, navigate to the Slide Show tab -> From Beginning; Arrow keys or mouse click will progress through the presentation.

If opening the document in PowerPoint Viewer, in the bottom right corner click Menu Icon -> Full Screen; Arrow keys or mouse click will progress through the presentation.

### Feature Prototype.xlsm

[**Click to download**](https://github.com/Gianni89/DesignTest/blob/master/Heavenstrike%20Rivals%20-%20Feature%20Design/Feature%20Prototype.xlsm?raw=true)

This spreadsheet is a macro enabled excel file and macro functionality will need to be enabled for the spreadsheet to function correctly. If macros are not enabled, you will be prompted to enable them.

The spreadsheet will be best understood after first having viewed the Design Presentation. The spreadsheet offers a prototype of the suggested design for designers to experiment with.

### Design Documentation.md

[**Click to view**](Heavenstrike%20Rivals%20-%20Feature%20Design/Design%20Documentation.md)

This markdown file is a simply formated overview of the feature design, suitable for quick reference during feature implementation, or to be uploaded to an internal wiki or version control platform. The file is natively formatted as markdown for github, but can be easily converted to alternative styles using pandoc.
